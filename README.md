# malt-example-models

This repo contains example models for Google's network topology representation,
MALT. We published our experiences with MALT in [NSDI
2020](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/mogul), and the
paper has more details.

The example models are published in the [protocol buffers text format
language](https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/textformat-spec/). For the
time being, we are not ready to release protobuf definitions for these examples.
